# -*-org-*-

An org-babel Axiom Example

Contains embedded LaTeX and calls to the Axiom process via the
axiom-environment system.  To publish this file to HTML and open in a
browser, do `C-c C-e b' in an Emacs org-mode buffer.  Make sure you
have a running Axiom process first by doing `M-x run-axiom'.

Define a couple of polynomials over the rationals, $p=x^2+1$ and
$q=x^3+1$, by

#+BEGIN_SRC axiom :exports both
p : UP(x, Fraction Integer) := x^2 + 1
q : UP(x, Fraction Integer) := x^3 + 1
#+END_SRC

then multiply them together

#+BEGIN_SRC axiom :exports both
a := p*q
#+END_SRC
